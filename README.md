# Student Grade Generator
This project is for developing a program that prompts a student to input marks and then it will be graded and then given out as an output. the grades will be as follows: A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40. The minimum value to be entered should be 0 and the maximum value should be 100.

# Speed Detector
This program takes a car speed value then if the value is less than 70 it should print "Ok" else for every 5km/s above 70 it should give one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. if the demerit points reach 12 points it should print "license suspended"
